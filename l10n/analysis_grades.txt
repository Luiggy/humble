[About this tool]

'humble' (https://github.com/rfc-st/humble/) is a strict tool when analyzing
HTTP response headers and their values, including the 'Experimental' ones.
It is based in large part on the information provided by 'MDN Web Docs',
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers.

And you may not agree with the results after analysis; and that's great and
necessary :)!: you should never blindly trust security tools; there must always
be a subsequent work that evaluates the real risk: non-existent, potential or
certain depending on the URL, environment and exposure.

[Grades and Associated Checks]

Ranked from worst to best:

E:  No 'Enabled headers' in the analysis
D:  'Deprecated/Insecure headers' in the analysis.
C:  'Missing headers' in the analysis.
B:  'Fingerprint headers' in the analysis.
A:  No warnings in the previous checks.
A+: No 'Empty headers' in the analysis.

Source files of the checks:

/additional/security.txt    ('Enabled headers')
/additional/insecure.txt    ('Deprecated/Insecure headers')
/additional/missing.txt     ('Missing headers')
/additional/fingerprint.txt ('Fingerprint headers')

[Improving Grades]

Evaluate the grades in relation to the exposure of the URL, its criticality and
the nature of the HTTP header: https://mdn.io/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete.

Use the '-s' parameter to exclude HTTP headers from the analysis (the
exclusions will be indicated in the results).

Don't get obsessed :). Maintain a constant security posture, as secure as
possible, documenting and updating it constantly.
